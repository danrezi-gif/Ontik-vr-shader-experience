# Ontik: VR Shader Experience

Experimental WebXR experiences exploring consciousness states through shader-based environments.

🌀 **[Live Demo](https://danrezi-gif.github.io/Ontik-vr-shader-experience/)**

## About

This project investigates how immersive VR and shader-based environments can render phenomenological states that exist beyond ordinary language—the territory where self-boundaries dissolve into something vast, ancient, and numinous.

Situated at the intersection of consciousness research, contemplative technology, and experimental art, these experiences prioritize atmosphere and phenomenological accuracy over traditional game mechanics. The aesthetic draws from cosmic horror, psychedelic visuals, and mystical traditions, creating navigable spaces that evoke both wonder and existential awe.
## Features

- **Complete 9-minute contemplative/horror experience** - Polished immersive journey
- **4 experimental pieces** - Early explorations of different phenomenological territories
- **WebXR-based** - Works in VR headsets and desktop browsers
- **Custom GLSL shaders** - Real-time visual rendering of consciousness states
- **Spatial audio design** - Headphones strongly recommended

## Experience Guide

**Optimal Setup:**

- VR headset (Quest, PSVR, PC VR) 
- Dedicated attention 

**Navigation:**

- VR: Use controllers or gaze-based selection

## Tech Stack

- **WebXR** - Cross-platform VR framework
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics library
- **GLSL Shaders** - Custom visual effects
- **JavaScript/HTML5** - Core implementation

## Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/danrezi-gif/Ontik-vr-shader-experience.git
cd Ontik-vr-shader-experience

# Serve with any static file server
# Example with Python:
python -m http.server 8000

# Or with Node.js:
npx http-server

# Open browser to localhost:8000
```

**Note:** WebXR requires HTTPS in production. Use a tool like `ngrok` for local VR testing.

## Project Context

This work is part of ongoing research into:

- Phenomenology of mystical experiences
- VR as contemplative technology
- Rendering subjective consciousness states
- Intersection of psychedelic research and creative technology

Developed by Daniel Rezinovsky, PhD candidate in Religious Studies at Rice University, working at the intersection of consciousness research, spirituality, and creative technology.

## Feedback Welcome

For those with direct experience of altered states, mystical encounters, or psychedelic experiences:

**What resonates? What feels authentic vs artificial?**

I’m particularly interested in how these visual/spatial metaphors land for people with firsthand phenomenological knowledge.

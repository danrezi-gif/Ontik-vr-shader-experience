# ONTIK: Contemplative VR Consciousness Experiences
## Technical Rider & Detailed Theoretical Description

---

## 1. CONCEPTUAL DESCRIPTION

**Ontik** is an immersive WebXR experience exploring consciousness states through custom GLSL shaders and spatial audio. Six contemplative journeysâ€”from cosmic wonder to ego dissolutionâ€”invite viewers into meditative VR environments that bridge mystical phenomenology and digital art.

Grounded in consciousness research and clinical psychology, each experience translates documented mystical states into navigable virtual spaces, creating contemplative technology at the intersection of art, science, and spirituality.

The project draws from cross-cultural mystical literature, psychedelic phenomenology, and contemplative traditions to render states that exist beyond ordinary languageâ€”the territory where self-boundaries dissolve into something vast, ancient, and numinous.

### Theoretical Framework

The work is informed by:
- **Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30)** research on core dimensions of mystical states
- **Phenomenology of religion** â€” Otto's concept of the *numinous*, Eliade's *hierophany*
- **Transpersonal psychology** â€” stages of ego dissolution, oceanic boundlessness, dread of ego loss
- **Contemplative neuroscience** â€” altered states of consciousness, default mode network dissolution

### The Six Experiences

1. **The Cosmic Attractor** â€” Gravitational pulls toward an unknowable center; evokes the numinous encounter
2. **Alpha and Omega** â€” Cyclical birth-death-rebirth patterns; explores cosmic temporality
3. **Infinite Gateway** â€” Portal-like transitions between phenomenological spaces; threshold experience
4. **The Ascension** â€” Vertical dissolution into luminous void; ego transcendence
5. **Transcendent Domain** â€” Non-euclidean sacred geometry; encounters with the wholly other
6. **Alien Womb** â€” Oceanic dissolution into primordial space; pre-egoic immersion

## 4. INSTALLATION DESIGN

### Concept: "Threshold Space"

The physical installation creates a transitional environmentâ€”a threshold between the festival's external stimulation and the contemplative interiority of the VR experience.

**Environmental Elements:**
- Dark fabric enclosure creating intimate, cave-like atmosphere
- Ambient low-frequency lighting (deep blue/purple LED strips)
- Projection screen visible from outside the enclosure, drawing visitors
- Minimal signage: "ExperiÃªncia Contemplativa VR â€” 9 minutos"
- Queue seating with cushions, contemplative/ambient music

**Visitor Flow:**
1. Visitors see projection from outside â†’ curiosity
2. Enter threshold space â†’ ambient transition
3. Seated, headset fitted (staff/artist assists)
4. 9-minute immersive experience
5. Headset removed â†’ integration moment (quiet seating available)
6. Exit

## 5. INTERACTION

### Visitor Role
- **Active participant** in a contemplative VR journey
- Navigation via VR controllers (locomotion) or head-gaze (passive)
- Each experience is approximately 5â€“9 minutes
- No prior VR experience required

### Interaction Model
- **VR Controllers:** Point-and-select for experience navigation in gallery
- **Head Tracking:** Shader environments respond to head movement and gaze direction
- **Hand Presence:** Glowing hand effects in VR for embodied presence
- **Audio:** Spatial audio responds to position and orientation

| Calibration & testing | 2 hours |
| Daily maintenance | 30 minutes |
| Dismantling | 2 hours |

### Daily Operations
- Headset cleaning between users (alcohol wipes)
- Battery check and charging rotation (if using Quest standalone)
- Content auto-loads from web â€” no manual file management needed
- Staff training: 15 minutes (headset fitting, basic troubleshooting)
